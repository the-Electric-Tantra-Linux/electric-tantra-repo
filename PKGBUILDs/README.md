# PKGBUILDs 

These files create packages out of pieces of the configuration of the Electric Tantra Linux, thus easing the inclusion of the
configurations that are being packaged within the ISO builds without keeping as large of a source tree, or as many submodules, 
thus reduce the complexities of teasing out issues as they arise from one of these configurations and allowing for an easier 
redistribution process.
