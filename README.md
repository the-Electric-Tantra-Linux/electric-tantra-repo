# Its Back

So the Electric Tantra Linux is going to be based on Artix Linux, as that is the most functional and documented means of producing an ISO which contains as complete a replication of my environment as possible. So this repository is active again as it will serve my needs in that process much as it had prior: hosting AUR packages I need in a repository that can be accessed via the internet by pacman without needing to play the root permissions game that chroot installing AUR packages with git clone commands does. 

If your needs differ much from the needs of the Electric Tantra Linux, which I assume they do in the vast majority of cases, then this is probably of little interest and no consequence to you at all and can safely be ignored.
